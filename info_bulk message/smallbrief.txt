Mailer solution is to have 2 different softwares.


1- Server.exe (it will be executed on my dedicated server which will listen to commands coming from Master.exe).
   its job to convert server into direct mailer without SMTP
   +add it self to startup

2- Master.exe (it will be running on my home pc, where i will control Mail-list, Subject, DATA letters, MAIL FROM:, Reply-to. 
   which going to be sent to server.exe and server will send emails using rotating proxies).


* (communication/traffic between all softwares must be encrypted)
